# ProjectJava
This Java project is designed to perform file encryption and decryption using multiple encryption algorithms, including DES, RSA, AES, and Blowfish. The project works with a file named originalFile.txt.

If you wish to use a different file name, you must modify the code. Specifically, update the file name on line 108 to your desired name. Make sure the updated file name matches the file you want to process.
